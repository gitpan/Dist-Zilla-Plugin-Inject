NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Inject - Inject into a CPAN::Mini mirror

VERSION
    version 0.001

      # in your dist.ini
      [Inject]
      author_id = EXAMPLE

      # injection is triggered at the release stage
      dzil release

DESCRIPTION
    "Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Inject" is a release-stage plugin that will inject
    your distribution into a local or remote CPAN::Mini mirror.

CONFIGURATION
  Author ID
    The only mandatory setting that "Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Inject" requires
    is the author id that will be used when injecting the module
    ("author_id").

  Injecting into a local repository
    "Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Inject" uses CPAN::Mini::Inject to inject your
    distribution into a local CPAN::Mini mirror. Thus, you need to have
    CPAN::Mini::Inject configured on your machine first. CPAN::Mini::Inject
    looks for its configuration file in a number of predefined locations
    (see its docs for details), or you can specify an explicit location via
    the "config_file" setting in your "dist.ini", e.g.:

      [Inject]
      author_id = EXAMPLE
      config_file = /home/example/.mcpani

  Injecting into a remote repository
    If you supply a "remote_server" setting in your "dist.ini",
    "Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Inject" will try to inject your distribution into
    a remote mirror via CPAN::Mini::Inject::Remote. A configured
    CPAN::Mini::Inject::Server must respond to the address specified in
    "remote_server", e.g.:

      [Inject]
      author_id = EXAMPLE
      remote_server = http://mcpani.example.com/
